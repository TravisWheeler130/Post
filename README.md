# Post


Post - Part One

Project Summary

Post is a simple global messaging service. Students will review MVC principles and work with URLSession, JSON parsing, and closures to build an app that lists and submits posts to a global feed.

Post is a single view application, with the main view being a list of all posts from the global feed listed in reverse-chronological order. The user can add posts via an alert controller presented after tapping an Add (+) bar button item.

Students who complete this project independently are able to:

use URLSession to make asynchronous GET HTTP requests
implement the Codable protocol to decode JSON data and generate model objects from requests
use closures to execute code when an asynchronous task is complete
use UIRefreshControl to reload data for a table view
Part One - Model Objects, Model Controller, URLSessionDataTask (HTTP GET method), Refresh Control

Setup

If you haven’t already, fork and clone this student repository from GitHub
Open the Post.xcodeproj in the Afternoon Projects/Unit 3 - Networking/Day 1 & 2/Post folder
Step One - Model Objects

Summary

In this step, you will create your Post model object, give it stored properties and a memberwise initializer.

Instructions

Create a model object that will represent the Post objects that are listed in the feed. This model object will be generated locally, but must also be able to be initialized by decoding JSON data after “GETting” from the backend database.

Create a Post.swift file and define a new Post struct.
Go to a sample endpoint of the Post API and see what JSON (information) you will get back for each post.
Using this information, add the properties on Post.
 Hint
</details>

Create a memberwise initializer that takes parameters for the username and text. Add a parameter for the timestamp, but set a default value for it.

Note: This memberwise initializer will only be used locally to generate new model objects. When initializing a new Post model object we will use the .timeIntervalSince1970 from the current date for the timestamp.

 Code Hint
Remember, unless you customize it to do otherwise, JSONEcoder will use the names of each property as the keys for the JSON data it creates. (EXACT spelling matters!)

There is one more computed property you will add to the Post type called queryTimestamp, but we will discuss that in Part 2.

Step Two - Model Controller

Summary

In this step, you will create a PostController class. This class will contain a function that will use a URLSessionDataTask to fetch data and will serialize the results into Post objects. This class will be used by the view controllers to fetch Post objects through completion closures.

Because you will only use one View Controller in this project, there is no reason to make this controller a singleton or shared controller. To learn more about when singletons may not be the best tool, review this article on Singleton Abuse. The key takeaway, for now, is that singletons aren’t always the right tool for the job and you should carefully consider if it is the best pattern for accessing data in your project.

Instructions

Create a PostController class

Add a constant baseURL to know the base URL for the /posts/ subdirectory. This URL will be used to build other URLs throughout the app.
 Code Hint
Add a posts property that will hold the Post objects that you pull and decode from the API.
 Hint
Add a method fetchPosts that provides a completion closure.
 Code Hint
Step Three - URLSessionDataTask

Summary

In the next steps, you will create an instance of URLSessionDataTask that will get the data at the endpoint URL.

Instructions

Create an unwrapped instance of the `baseURL.

Hint: use a guard let statement
Create a constant getterEndpoint which takes the unwrapped baseURL and appends a path extension of "json"
 Code Hint
Create an instance of URLRequest and give it the getterEndpoint. (It’s very important that you not forget to set the request’s httpMethod and httpBody.)
The httpBody and httpMethod are used to tell the API what we are going to do with URLSessionDataTask. We will go into more detail on this later, but for now, know that “GET” is used to receive the JSON data from the API.

 Code Hint
Create an instance of URLSessionDataTask This method will make the network call and call the completion closer with the Data?, URLResponse? and Error? results.
 Code Hint
Important: Don’t forget to call resume() after creating this instance. Do this by putting dataTask.resume() after the let dataTask = URLSession...’s closing brace.)
In the closure of the dataTask(with: URLRequest, completionHandler: ...), you will need to handle the results it comes back with

Enter request for the URLRequest parameter, and then highlight the completionHandler and press your Return key

You will need to give the Data?, URLResponse? and Error? results each a name. We suggest (data, _, error). (You can use the ‘_’ (wildcard) when naming the URLResponse because we will not be using it in this project)

If the dataTask was successful at retrieving data, data will have value, and error will not. The opposite is also true. If unsuccessful, data will be nil and error will have value.

First, we need to Check for an error. If there is an error, print that error, call completion(), and return.

Hint: Use an if let to check if error has a value
 Code Hint
Unwrap data if there is any.
Hint: Don’t forget to call completion() and return in the else block.
Create an instance of JSONDecoder

Before adding the next step you will need your Post model object to adopt the Codable protocol.

Call decode(from:) on your instance of the JSONDecoder. You will need to assign the return of this function to a constant named postsDictionary. This function takes in two arguments: a type [String:Post].self, and your instance of data that came back from the network request. This will decode the data into a [String:Post] (a dictionary with keys being the UUID that they are stored under on the database as you will see by inspecting the json returned from the network request, and values which should be actual instances of post).
NOTE: You will also notice that this function throws. That means that if you call this function and it doesn’t work the way it should, it will throw an error. Functions that throw need to be marked with try in front of the function call. You will also need to put this call inside of a do-catch block and catch the error that might be thrown. If there is an error caught, you will want to print the error, call completion() and return. Review the documentation if you need to learn about do catch blocks.
Call compactMap on this dictionary, pulling out the Post from each key-value pair. Assign the new array of posts to a variable named posts. Look at the documentation for compactMap to help you remember what it does.
 Code Hint
Next, you’ll need to sort these posts by timestamp in reverse chronological order (*the newest one is first). You can do this by calling sort on the posts array. Look at the documentation for sort to help you remember what it does.
 Code Hint
Now assign the array of sorted posts to self.posts and call completion().

Remember: If you call return anywhere in this function, remember to call completion() before returning. This way you will avoid “leaving the caller hanging” if return ever gets called before adding the fetched posts to your array.
As of iOS 9, Apple is boosting security and requiring developers to use the secure HTTPS protocol and require the server to use the proper TLS Certificate version. The Post API does support HTTPS but does not use the correct TLS Certificate version. So for this app, you will need to turn off the App Transport Security feature.

Open your Info.plist file and add a key-value pair to your Info.plist. This key-value pair should be: App Transport Security Settings : [Allow Arbitrary Loads: YES].
At this point, you should be able to pull the Post data from the API and decode it into a list of Post objects. Test this functionality with a Playground or by calling this function in your App Delegate and trying to print the results from the API to the console.

Because you will always want to fetch posts whenever the table view appears, you will want to call fetchPosts() in viewDidLoad() of your PostListViewController. This will start the call to fetch posts and assign them to the posts property. (You will create this TableViewController in the next step)

Step Four - View Controller

Summary

Build out a View Controller with a Table View to display each post as an individual cell.

Instructions

Add a UIViewController as your root view controller in Main.storyboard and embed it in a UINavigationController

Add a title to the navigation item. You can choose what title you would like to put

Add a UITableView to the view controller and set its constraints to fill the entire view controllers root view

Make sure to add a prototype cell to the table view. Set the cell’s reuse identifier to postCell and set the cell’s style to Subtitle

Create a PostListViewController file as a subclass of UIViewController and set the class of your root view controller scene

Drag an IBOutlet of the table view from the storyboard into the PostListViewController.

Conform the PostListViewController to the UITableViewDelegate and the UITableViewDataSource protocols

Assign the PostListViewController as the table view’s delegate and data source

Hint: You can do this programmatically or in storyboards
Add a postController property to PostListViewController and set it to an instance of PostController

Implement the UITableViewDataSource functions using the included postController.posts array

Set the cell.textLabel to the text, and the cell.detailTextLabel to the author and post date

Note: It may also help to temporarily add the indexPath.row to the cell.detailTextLabel to quickly determine if the posts are showing up where you expect them to be
Add the fetchPosts function of the post controller to viewDidLoad

Step Five - Dynamic Cell Height

Summary

The length of the text on each Post is variable. Add support for dynamic resizing cells to your table view so messages are not truncated.

Instructions

In the viewDidLoad() function, set the tableView.estimatedRowHeight to 45
45 is used because that is similar to the default value of non-customized cells. If you have a larger sized custom cell, you can set the estimated height to that
Set the tableView.rowHeight to UITableView.automaticDimension

Update the textLabel and detailTextLabel on the Post List storyboard scene to support multiple lines by setting the number of lines to 0 in the attributes inspector.
Step Six - Refresh Control

Summary

Add a UIRefreshControl to the table view to support the ‘pull to refresh’ gesture. Refer to the documentation to read more about the refresh control.

Instructions

In your PostListViewController file, create a new variable called refreshControl and initialize it as a UIRefreshControl

In viewDidLoad, set the table views .refreshControl property to the refresh control you just created in the last step.

Create a new function called refreshControlPulled(). Add @objc before the func for this function.

@objc is an Objective C holdover that allows us to use some Objective C methods. UIRefreshControl has an Objective C method to allows us to call a function when we drag to refresh the table view.

 Code Hint
Now you need to add the @objc function we just created to the refresh control. To do this, you call the .addTarget method on the refreshControl. The target will be self, the selector will be #selector(refreshControlPulled) and the control event will be .valueChanged

 Code Hint
Inside the refreshControlPulled function, make a call to the PostController’s fetchPost function

Tell UIRefreshControl to end refreshing when the fetchPosts is complete.

Hint: This needs to be called on the main thread

 Code Hint
Step Seven - Custom Reload Table View Function

Summary

Create a function that we’ll call in several places to reload the table view on the main thread after fetchPosts is called and the completion closure runs.

Instructions

Create a function called reloadTableView. In this function, you will want to reload the tableview. Make sure you run this on the main thread.

Add this function to the closure of any fetchPosts function called in the PostListViewController

Step Eight - Network Activity Indicator

Summary

It is good practice to let the user know that a network request is processing. This is most commonly done using the Network Activity Indicator in the status bar.

Instructions

Look up the documentation for the isNetworkActivityIndicatorVisible property on UIApplication to turn on the indicator when fetching new posts

Turn it off when the network call is complete. You should add this to the reloadTableView function

Hint: This needs to be ran on the main thread
Part One is now complete. You should be able to run the app, fetch all of the posts from the API, and have them display in the table view. Look for bugs and fix any that you may find.

Black Diamonds

Use a computed .date property, DateComponents and DateFormatters to display the Post date in the correct time zone
